The tool should sort the files on Desktop on the basis of file extension and move them in
separate folders in Documents folder.

Example: If there are 10 MP3 files, 3 word documents, 4 PDFs then in Documents Folder three
folders should be created with name MP3, DOC and PDF and all the files on the Desktop should
be moved into these directories based on their file type or extension. Desktop should be cleaned
but dont remove shortcuts of My Computer,etc
